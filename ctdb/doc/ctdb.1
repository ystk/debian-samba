.SH "NAME"
ctdb \- CTDB management utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBctdb\fR\ 'u
\fBctdb\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...] {\fICOMMAND\fR} [\fICOMMAND\-ARGS\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
ctdb is a utility to view and manage a CTDB cluster\&.
.PP
The following terms are used when referring to nodes in a cluster:
.PP
PNN
.RS 4
Physical Node Number\&. The physical node number is an integer that describes the node in the cluster\&. The first node has physical node number 0\&. in a cluster\&.
.RE
.PP
PNN\-LIST
.RS 4
This is either a single PNN, a comma\-separate list of PNNs or "all"\&.
.RE
.PP
Commands that reference a database use the following terms:
.PP
DB
.RS 4
This is either a database name, such as
locking\&.tdb
or a database ID such as "0x42fe72c5"\&.
.RE
.PP
DB\-LIST
.RS 4
A space separated list of at least one
\fIDB\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-n \fIPNN\-LIST\fR
.RS 4
The nodes specified by PNN\-LIST should be queried for the requested information\&. Default is to query the daemon running on the local host\&.
.RE
.PP
\-Y
.RS 4
Produce output in machine readable form for easier parsing by scripts\&. This uses a field delimiter of \*(Aq:\*(Aq\&. Not all commands support this option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-x \fISEPARATOR\fR
.RS 4
Use SEPARATOR to delimit fields in machine readable output\&. This implies \-Y\&.
.RE
.PP
\-X
.RS 4
Produce output in machine readable form for easier parsing by scripts\&. This uses a field delimiter of \*(Aq|\*(Aq\&. Not all commands support this option\&.
.sp
This is equivalent to "\-x|" and avoids some shell quoting issues\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t \fITIMEOUT\fR
.RS 4
Indicates that ctdb should wait up to TIMEOUT seconds for a response to most commands sent to the CTDB daemon\&. The default is 10 seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\-T \fITIMELIMIT\fR
.RS 4
Indicates that TIMELIMIT is the maximum run time (in seconds) for the ctdb command\&. When TIMELIMIT is exceeded the ctdb command will terminate with an error\&. The default is 120 seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\-? \-\-help
.RS 4
Print some help text to the screen\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-usage
.RS 4
Print useage information to the screen\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d \-\-debug=\fIDEBUGLEVEL\fR
.RS 4
Change the debug level for the command\&. Default is ERR (0)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-socket=\fIFILENAME\fR
.RS 4
Specify that FILENAME is the name of the Unix domain socket to use when connecting to the local CTDB daemon\&. The default is
/tmp/ctdb\&.socket\&.
.RE
.SH "ADMINISTRATIVE COMMANDS"
.PP
These are commands used to monitor and administer a CTDB cluster\&.
.SS "pnn"
.PP
This command displays the PNN of the current node\&.
.SS "xpnn"
.PP
This command displays the PNN of the current node without contacting the CTDB daemon\&. It parses the nodes file directly, so can produce unexpected output if the nodes file has been edited but has not been reloaded\&.
.SS "status"
.PP
This command shows the current status of all CTDB nodes based on information from the queried node\&.
.PP
Note: If the the queried node is INACTIVE then the status might not be current\&.
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNode status\fR
.RS 4
.PP
This includes the number of physical nodes and the status of each node\&. See
\fBctdb\fR(7)
for information about node states\&.
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBGeneration\fR
.RS 4
.PP
The generation id is a number that indicates the current generation of a cluster instance\&. Each time a cluster goes through a reconfiguration or a recovery its generation id will be changed\&.
.PP
This number does not have any particular meaning other than to keep track of when a cluster has gone through a recovery\&. It is a random number that represents the current instance of a ctdb cluster and its databases\&. The CTDB daemon uses this number internally to be able to tell when commands to operate on the cluster and the databases was issued in a different generation of the cluster, to ensure that commands that operate on the databases will not survive across a cluster database recovery\&. After a recovery, all old outstanding commands will automatically become invalid\&.
.PP
Sometimes this number will be shown as "INVALID"\&. This only means that the ctdbd daemon has started but it has not yet merged with the cluster through a recovery\&. All nodes start with generation "INVALID" and are not assigned a real generation id until they have successfully been merged with a cluster through a recovery\&.
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBVirtual Node Number (VNN) map\fR
.RS 4
.PP
Consists of the number of virtual nodes and mapping from virtual node numbers to physical node numbers\&. Virtual nodes host CTDB databases\&. Only nodes that are participating in the VNN map can become lmaster or dmaster for database records\&.
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBRecovery mode\fR
.RS 4
.PP
This is the current recovery mode of the cluster\&. There are two possible modes:
.PP
NORMAL \- The cluster is fully operational\&.
.PP
RECOVERY \- The cluster databases have all been frozen, pausing all services while the cluster awaits a recovery process to complete\&. A recovery process should finish within seconds\&. If a cluster is stuck in the RECOVERY state this would indicate a cluster malfunction which needs to be investigated\&.
.PP
Once the recovery master detects an inconsistency, for example a node becomes disconnected/connected, the recovery daemon will trigger a cluster recovery process, where all databases are remerged across the cluster\&. When this process starts, the recovery master will first "freeze" all databases to prevent applications such as samba from accessing the databases and it will also mark the recovery mode as RECOVERY\&.
.PP
When the CTDB daemon starts up, it will start in RECOVERY mode\&. Once the node has been merged into a cluster and all databases have been recovered, the node mode will change into NORMAL mode and the databases will be "thawed", allowing samba to access the databases again\&.
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBRecovery master\fR
.RS 4
.PP
This is the cluster node that is currently designated as the recovery master\&. This node is responsible of monitoring the consistency of the cluster and to perform the actual recovery process when reqired\&.
.PP
Only one node at a time can be the designated recovery master\&. Which node is designated the recovery master is decided by an election process in the recovery daemons running on each node\&.

.SS "nodestatus [\fIPNN\-LIST\fR]"
.PP
This command is similar to the
\fBstatus\fR
command\&. It displays the "node status" subset of output\&. The main differences are:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The exit code is the bitwise\-OR of the flags for each specified node, while
\fBctdb status\fR
exits with 0 if it was able to retrieve status for all nodes\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBctdb status\fR
provides status information for all nodes\&.
\fBctdb nodestatus\fR
defaults to providing status for only the current node\&. If PNN\-LIST is provided then status is given for the indicated node(s)\&.
.sp
By default,
\fBctdb nodestatus\fR
gathers status from the local node\&. However, if invoked with "\-n all" (or similar) then status is gathered from the given node(s)\&. In particular
\fBctdb nodestatus all\fR
and
\fBctdb nodestatus \-n all\fR
will produce different output\&. It is possible to provide 2 different nodespecs (with and without "\-n") but the output is usually confusing!
.RE
.PP
A common invocation in scripts is
\fBctdb nodestatus all\fR
to check whether all nodes in a cluster are healthy\&.

.PP
This command shows which node is currently the LVSMASTER\&. The LVSMASTER is the node in the cluster which drives the LVS system and which receives all incoming traffic from clients\&.
.PP
LVS is the mode where the entire CTDB/Samba cluster uses a single ip address for the entire cluster\&. In this mode all clients connect to one specific node which will then multiplex/loadbalance the clients evenly onto the other nodes in the cluster\&. This is an alternative to using public ip addresses\&. See the manpage for ctdbd for more information about LVS\&.
.SS "lvs"
.PP
This command shows which nodes in the cluster are currently active in the LVS configuration\&. I\&.e\&. which nodes we are currently loadbalancing the single ip address across\&.
.PP
LVS will by default only loadbalance across those nodes that are both LVS capable and also HEALTHY\&. Except if all nodes are UNHEALTHY in which case LVS will loadbalance across all UNHEALTHY nodes as well\&. LVS will never use nodes that are DISCONNECTED, STOPPED, BANNED or DISABLED\&.

.SS "setreclock [filename]"
.PP
This command is used to modify, or clear, the file that is used as the reclock file at runtime\&. When this command is used, the reclock file checks are disabled\&. To re\-enable the checks the administrator needs to activate the "VerifyRecoveryLock" tunable using "ctdb setvar"\&.
.PP
If run with no parameter this will remove the reclock file completely\&. If run with a parameter the parameter specifies the new filename to use for the recovery lock\&.
.PP
This command only affects the runtime settings of a ctdb node and will be lost when ctdb is restarted\&. For persistent changes to the reclock file setting you must edit /etc/sysconfig/ctdb\&.
.SS "getdebug"
.PP
Get the current debug level for the node\&. the debug level controls what information is written to the log file\&.
.PP
The debug levels are mapped to the corresponding syslog levels\&. When a debug level is set, only those messages at that level and higher levels will be printed\&.
.PP
The list of debug levels from highest to lowest are :
.PP
EMERG ALERT CRIT ERR WARNING NOTICE INFO DEBUG
.SS "setdebug \fIDEBUGLEVEL\fR"
.PP
Set the debug level of a node\&. This controls what information will be logged\&.
.PP
The debuglevel is one of EMERG ALERT CRIT ERR WARNING NOTICE INFO DEBUG
.SS "getpid"
.PP
This command will return the process id of the ctdb daemon\&.
.SS "disable"
.PP
This command is used to administratively disable a node in the cluster\&. A disabled node will still participate in the cluster and host clustered TDB records but its public ip address has been taken over by a different node and it no longer hosts any services\&.
.SS "enable"
.PP
Re\-enable a node that has been administratively disabled\&.
.SS "stop"
.PP
This command is used to administratively STOP a node in the cluster\&. A STOPPED node is connected to the cluster but will not host any public ip addresse, nor does it participate in the VNNMAP\&. The difference between a DISABLED node and a STOPPED node is that a STOPPED node does not host any parts of the database which means that a recovery is required to stop/continue nodes\&.
.SS "continue"
.PP
Re\-start a node that has been administratively stopped\&.
.SS "addip \fIIPADDR\fR/\fImask\fR \fIIFACE\fR"
.PP
This command is used to add a new public ip to a node during runtime\&. This allows public addresses to be added to a cluster without having to restart the ctdb daemons\&.
.PP
Note that this only updates the runtime instance of ctdb\&. Any changes will be lost next time ctdb is restarted and the public addresses file is re\-read\&. If you want this change to be permanent you must also update the public addresses file manually\&.
.SS "delip \fIIPADDR\fR"
.PP
This command is used to remove a public ip from a node during runtime\&. If this public ip is currently hosted by the node it being removed from, the ip will first be failed over to another node, if possible, before it is removed\&.
.PP
Note that this only updates the runtime instance of ctdb\&. Any changes will be lost next time ctdb is restarted and the public addresses file is re\-read\&. If you want this change to be permanent you must also update the public addresses file manually\&.
.SS "moveip \fIIPADDR\fR \fIPNN\fR"
.PP
This command can be used to manually fail a public ip address to a specific node\&.
.PP
In order to manually override the "automatic" distribution of public ip addresses that ctdb normally provides, this command only works when you have changed the tunables for the daemon to:
.PP
DeterministicIPs = 0
.PP
NoIPFailback = 1
.SS "shutdown"
.PP
This command will shutdown a specific CTDB daemon\&.
.SS "setlmasterrole on|off"
.PP
This command is used ot enable/disable the LMASTER capability for a node at runtime\&. This capability determines whether or not a node can be used as an LMASTER for records in the database\&. A node that does not have the LMASTER capability will not show up in the vnnmap\&.
.PP
Nodes will by default have this capability, but it can be stripped off nodes by the setting in the sysconfig file or by using this command\&.
.PP
Once this setting has been enabled/disabled, you need to perform a recovery for it to take effect\&.
.PP
See also "ctdb getcapabilities"
.SS "setrecmasterrole on|off"
.PP
This command is used ot enable/disable the RECMASTER capability for a node at runtime\&. This capability determines whether or not a node can be used as an RECMASTER for the cluster\&. A node that does not have the RECMASTER capability can not win a recmaster election\&. A node that already is the recmaster for the cluster when the capability is stripped off the node will remain the recmaster until the next cluster election\&.
.PP
Nodes will by default have this capability, but it can be stripped off nodes by the setting in the sysconfig file or by using this command\&.
.PP
See also "ctdb getcapabilities"
.SS "reloadnodes"
.PP
This command is used when adding new nodes, or removing existing nodes from an existing cluster\&.
.PP
Procedure to add a node:
.PP
1, To expand an existing cluster, first ensure with \*(Aqctdb status\*(Aq that all nodes are up and running and that they are all healthy\&. Do not try to expand a cluster unless it is completely healthy!
.PP
2, On all nodes, edit /etc/ctdb/nodes and add the new node as the last entry to the file\&. The new node MUST be added to the end of this file!
.PP
3, Verify that all the nodes have identical /etc/ctdb/nodes files after you edited them and added the new node!
.PP
4, Run \*(Aqctdb reloadnodes\*(Aq to force all nodes to reload the nodesfile\&.
.PP
5, Use \*(Aqctdb status\*(Aq on all nodes and verify that they now show the additional node\&.
.PP
6, Install and configure the new node and bring it online\&.
.PP
Procedure to remove a node:
.PP
1, To remove a node from an existing cluster, first ensure with \*(Aqctdb status\*(Aq that all nodes, except the node to be deleted, are up and running and that they are all healthy\&. Do not try to remove a node from a cluster unless the cluster is completely healthy!
.PP
2, Shutdown and poweroff the node to be removed\&.
.PP
3, On all other nodes, edit the /etc/ctdb/nodes file and comment out the node to be removed\&. Do not delete the line for that node, just comment it out by adding a \*(Aq#\*(Aq at the beginning of the line\&.
.PP
4, Run \*(Aqctdb reloadnodes\*(Aq to force all nodes to reload the nodesfile\&.
.PP
5, Use \*(Aqctdb status\*(Aq on all nodes and verify that the deleted node no longer shows up in the list\&.\&.
.PP
.SS "reloadips [\fIPNN\-LIST\fR]"
.PP
This command reloads the public addresses configuration file on the specified nodes\&. When it completes addresses will be reconfigured and reassigned across the cluster as necessary\&.
.SS "getdbmap"
.PP
This command lists all clustered TDB databases that the CTDB daemon has attached to\&. Some databases are flagged as PERSISTENT, this means that the database stores data persistently and the data will remain across reboots\&. One example of such a database is secrets\&.tdb where information about how the cluster was joined to the domain is stored\&.
.PP
If a PERSISTENT database is not in a healthy state the database is flagged as UNHEALTHY\&. If there\*(Aqs at least one completely healthy node running in the cluster, it\*(Aqs possible that the content is restored by a recovery run automaticly\&. Otherwise an administrator needs to analyze the problem\&.
.PP
See also "ctdb getdbstatus", "ctdb backupdb", "ctdb restoredb", "ctdb dumpbackup", "ctdb wipedb", "ctdb setvar AllowUnhealthyDBRead 1" and (if samba or tdb\-utils are installed) "tdbtool check"\&.
.PP
Most databases are not persistent and only store the state information that the currently running samba daemons need\&. These databases are always wiped when ctdb/samba starts and when a node is rebooted\&.

Send a TCP tickle to the source host for the specified TCP connection\&. A TCP tickle is a TCP ACK packet with an invalid sequence and acknowledge number and will when received by the source host result in it sending an immediate correct ACK back to the other end\&.
.PP
TCP tickles are useful to "tickle" clients after a IP failover has occured since this will make the client immediately recognize the TCP connection has been disrupted and that the client will need to reestablish\&.

.SS "recover"
.PP
This command will trigger the recovery daemon to do a cluster recovery\&.
.SS "ipreallocate, sync"
.PP
This command will force the recovery master to perform a full ip reallocation process and redistribute all ip addresses\&. This is useful to "reset" the allocations back to its default state if they have been changed using the "moveip" command\&. While a "recover" will also perform this reallocation, a recovery is much more hevyweight since it will also rebuild all the databases\&.
.SS "getmonmode"
.PP
This command returns the monutoring mode of a node\&. The monitoring mode is either ACTIVE or DISABLED\&. Normally a node will continuously monitor that all other nodes that are expected are in fact connected and that they respond to commands\&.
.PP
ACTIVE \- This is the normal mode\&. The node is actively monitoring all other nodes, both that the transport is connected and also that the node responds to commands\&. If a node becomes unavailable, it will be marked as DISCONNECTED and a recovery is initiated to restore the cluster\&.
.PP
DISABLED \- This node is not monitoring that other nodes are available\&. In this mode a node failure will not be detected and no recovery will be performed\&. This mode is useful when for debugging purposes one wants to attach GDB to a ctdb process but wants to prevent the rest of the cluster from marking this node as DISCONNECTED and do a recovery\&.
.SS "setmonmode 0|1"
.PP
This command can be used to explicitly disable/enable monitoring mode on a node\&. The main purpose is if one wants to attach GDB to a running ctdb daemon but wants to prevent the other nodes from marking it as DISCONNECTED and issuing a recovery\&. To do this, set monitoring mode to 0 on all nodes before attaching with GDB\&. Remember to set monitoring mode back to 1 afterwards\&.
.SS "attach \fIDBNAME\fR [persistent]"
.PP
Create a new CTDB database called DBNAME and attach to it on all nodes\&.
.SS "detach \fIDB\-LIST\fR"

Detach specified non\-persistent database(s) from the cluster\&. This command will disconnect specified database(s) on all nodes in the cluster\&. This command should only be used when none of the specified database(s) are in use\&.
.PP
All nodes should be active and tunable AllowClientDBAccess should be disabled on all nodes before detaching databases\&.
.SS "dumpmemory"

Administratively ban a node for BANTIME seconds\&. The node will be unbanned after BANTIME seconds have elapsed\&.
.PP
A banned node does not participate in the cluster\&. It does not host any records for the clustered TDB and does not host any public IP addresses\&.
.PP
Nodes are automatically banned if they misbehave\&. For example, a node may be banned if it causes too many cluster recoveries\&.
