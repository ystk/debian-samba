-To set this up, first set up your smb\&.conf by adding to the [global] section: usershare path = /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares Next create the directory /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares, change the owner to root and set the group owner to the UNIX group who should have the ability to create usershares, for example a group called "serverops"\&. Set the permissions on /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares to 01770\&. (Owner and group all access, no access for others, plus the sticky bit, which means that a file in that directory can be renamed or deleted only by the owner of the file)\&. Finally, tell smbd how many usershares you will allow by adding to the [global] section of smb\&.conf a line such as : usershare max shares = 100\&. To allow 100 usershare definitions\&. Now, members of the UNIX group "serverops" can create user defined shares on demand using the commands below\&.
