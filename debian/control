Description: SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with
 Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function
 as an NT4-style domain controller, and can integrate with both NT4 domains
 and Active Directory realms as a member server.
 .
 This package provides the components necessary to use Samba as a
 stand-alone file and print server.  For use in an NT4 domain or Active
 Directory realm, you will also need the winbind package.
 .
 This package is not required for connecting to existing SMB/CIFS servers
 (see smbclient) or for mounting remote filesystems (see cifs-utils).

Description: Samba Web Administration Tool
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with
 Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.
 .
 This package allows you to administer a Samba server via a web browser.
 .
 SWAT is no longer actively maintained, and its default configuration is
 not secure for use over an untrusted network.  SWAT will also rewrite
 smb.conf, rearranging the entries and deleting all comments as well as
 include= and copy= options, so is not suitable for use in conjunction
 with hand-edited smb.conf files or the default package-managed
 configuration.

Description: pluggable authentication module for Samba
 This is a module for PAM that enables a system administrator to migrate
 user passwords from the Unix password database to the SMB password
 database as used by Samba, and to subsequently keep the two databases in
 sync.  Unlike other solutions, it does this without needing users to log
 in to Samba using cleartext passwords, or requiring them to change their
 existing passwords.
